The Spark Button has a lot of features, but some of these aren't as straightforward to use as simple LEDs and sensors. This library wraps up a lot of the complexity and provides simple functions with broad capability. It wraps modified versions of both Adafruit's Neopixel and AnneM's ADXL362 Arduino libraries, as well as some novel functions.

Examples:
1.Blink an LED - How to control the smart LEDs on this board
2.Blink all the LEDs - An extension on the simplest case
3.LEDs and Buttons - How to read the buttons on the Button, and make LEDs blink with them
4.Motion - The Spark Button also has an accelerometer on it to measure motion- this shows how the related functions work


Watch for gauge and other display additions to this library!
